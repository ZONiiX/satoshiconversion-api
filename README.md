Satoshi conversion API

# As of now:
This would be my first time making an API so the process too a lot of learning. However me being that smart person that I am, forgot that this API would only work on a local network as it was hosted in 128.0.0.1:5000. So upon doing research I figured that I should host this small tidbit of code on AWS Lambda. If you are interested in the hosted API here it is: https://gntf7hd0uj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/satoshiAPI
